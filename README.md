# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Vehicle length and ground clearance were determined to have a high level of variance relative to the dataset.  Vehicle weigth, spoiler angle and AWD were non-random.
- The slope of this linear model is not linear, since the R^2 is 71% there is enough data to show there is significance in the linear relationship, so the slope is not 0.  
- The model is a moderately effective predictor of mpg for MechaCar prototypes, as it has an R Squared of 0.71 (71%) and therefore is the model is a relatively good predictor     of MPG.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- The current manufacturing data, in its totality, does not meet the design specification requirements due to the variance of Lot 3 exceeding the 100 pounds per square inch variance guideline.  Lot 1 + 2 satisfied the criteria, but Lot 3 had a variance above the minimum requirement.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
- then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

-Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

-In your description, address the following questions:

-What metric or metrics are you going to test?

-What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

-What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

-What data is needed to run the statistical test?
