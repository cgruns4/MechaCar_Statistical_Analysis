# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- The current manufacturing data, in its totality, does not meet the design specification requirements due to the variance of Lot 3 exceeding the 100 pounds per square inch variance guideline.  Lot 1 + 2 satisfied the criteria, but Lot 3 had a variance above the minimum requirement.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
- then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

-Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

-In your description, address the following questions:

-What metric or metrics are you going to test?

-What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

-What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

-What data is needed to run the statistical test?
